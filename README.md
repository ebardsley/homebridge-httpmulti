# homebridge-httpmulti
A generic homebridge module that allows for URLs to be triggered for most actions

v2 of this accessory seems to mostly work. I can control all the objects with either the IOS10 home app or Siri. More work needs to be done for status, but for now this should be a decent update for anyone using it.
